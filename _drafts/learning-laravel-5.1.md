This is the first in a series of Laravel tutorials. My aim is to split them up into independant tutorials that you can pick up at any time

1. [Composer](#c_composer)
2. [VirtualBox & VMware](#c_vb_vmware)
3. [Homestead](#c_homestead)
4. [Laravel](#c_laravel)

##Composer[]()
download curl

php composer.phar

composer

`mv composer.phar /usr/local/bin/composer`

set to go

##VirtualBox &amp; VMware<a name="c_vb_vmare"></a>

##Homestead<a name="c_homestead"></a>

##Laravel<a name="c_laravel"></a>

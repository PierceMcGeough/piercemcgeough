Hi there, I'm Pierce. I am a web developer and kickboxer based in Newry Co. Down. 

## Web Development
I started my web development career just after finishing my BTEC National Diploma with the [SRC Newry](http://www.src.ac.uk). I completed a summer work placement with a small web company in Newry called Northern Web Technologies. Here, after being thrown into the deep end, I found the joys of the challenge of building websites based on a set out design. 

I then retured to the SRC to complete a two year Foundation Degree in Interactive Multimedia Design which lead on to a further two years to complete a full BSc Hons degreen in Interactive Multimedia Design at the [Univeristy of Ulster - Jordanstown](http://www.ulster.ac.uk).

Afterwards and until now I have joined as an in-house front end developer with RentPro Ltd. working on their lastest project called [ShowHouse](http://www.showhousesoftware.com).

## Kickboxing
I started <a href="http://mugendoassociationofireland.ie" target="_blank">Mugendo</a> kickboxing in October of 2004. It has been a constant part of my life ever since. On the 19th January 2014 I graded to my first degree black belt and soon took over the running of the Newry kickboxing club.

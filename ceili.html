        <h3>Hi Ceili</h3>
        <p>I thought throwing this page together will help give you a better understanding on what I have done and I need to do etc... Hopefully it will be easier to read than in the message box.</p>

        <h3>What I want to achieve</h3>
        <p>I want to run a few sites that I have on Digital Ocean.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Is there an easy way to do this with Homestead (or something different if you recommend)?</strong><br>
          Just run the box like i do in vagrant?
        </p>
        <p>Get my current DO site to use a domain name. I am currently using an IP for a site <a href="http://104.236.27.195/">http://104.236.27.195/</a></p>
        <p>I would like to deploy via Git, I just Bitbucket for private personal sites.</p>
        <p>
          Understand GitFlow workflow with others. (Maybe leave this for a seperate session)?<br>
          <em>We currently use SVN in work and looking to upgrade. I can follow these single Git tutorials OK but the idea working with a group confuses and scares me.</em>
        </p>

        
        <h3>What I have done</h3>
        <p>I currently have two wordpress sites that I developed locally on MAMP and are hosted on shared hosting</p>
        <p>I also have 1 Laravel app (static site using laravel) using Vagrant and Homestead locally, and hosted on DO but not properly configured.</p>
        <p><em>As far as I am aware I should be able to run my local WP sites through vagrant & homestead, but have just never gotten around to it.</em></p>

        <h3>DO Setup</h3>
        <p>I've linked my DO setup here.  I asked about it on StackOverflow. <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26933476/setup-laravel-app-on-digitalocen">My SO question inc DO setup</a>.  Note I also used the answer selected.</p>
        <p>I was switching between 2 tutorials. The main one was by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-ok9d_6xrc">PHP Academy</a> and then <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-laravel-with-nginx-on-an-ubuntu-12-04-lts-vps">Digital Oceans</a></p>
        
        <h3>My Git folders/files</h3>
        <p>This is my local and Bitbucket setup. For the purpose of deploying.....I think. My root repo is not the folder I want live. I want a sub folder live. <br><em>because I will only want my app folder live.</em></p>
<pre>
<code>
sitename
  - design (folder with design related items i.e. content, database sql files, site design, etc..)    
  - app (root of application - laravel, wordpress, etc...)

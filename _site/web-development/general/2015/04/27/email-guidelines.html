    <p>The following is a revision from a talk at Smashing Conf Oxford 2014. This was my second web conference that I attended. There were many great talks and this was one that stuck out in my mind as it was something I was currently working on at work.</p>

<h3>Be Responsive</h3>

<p>First you need to make sure to have a good responsive layout. Most system users will likely signup using a desktop and then receive their first email straight away, however the majority of their follow up emails will most likely be read on a mobile device.</p>

<p><strong>67% of mobile internet activities is sending and receiving emails</strong></p>

<h3>Guides</h3>

<p>There are three general rules for mobile layouts:</p>

<ul>
<li>  1 Eyeball</li>
<li>  1 Thumb</li>
<li>  At arms length</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1 Eyeball</strong> – means that the user can read the email while being distracted. Important information will get noticed and remembered. </p>

<p><strong>1 Thumb (mainly mobile)</strong> – this means that any major calls to action are easily clickable. Minimum of 46px squared is a recommended size. Any other links should also be kept apart to avoid the user accidently clicking the wrong link.</p>

<p><strong>At arms length</strong> – easy to read. Text size is recommended to be a minimum of 16px, images should be nicely sized and colour contrast should be adequate for the user to read with ease.</p>

<h3>Email Types</h3>

<p>When you send emails you should note that there are four main purposes why you send them:</p>

<ul>
<li>  Buy Me</li>
<li>  Join Me</li>
<li>  Read Me</li>
<li>  Transactional</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Buy Me</strong> – these emails are trying to sell the product (or an addon for the product). The copy should be concise with simple calls to action. Use images in these emails to build enticement for the user to spend money.</p>

<p><strong>Join Me</strong> – these emails are generally a notice or invitation to events. Copy in these is limited to important details and are clear for the user to see and easy to remember. Bold calls to action are used.</p>

<p><strong>Read Me</strong> – these are generally newsletter emails. While you may get large number to users who won’t read these you still need to make it as easy and pleasurable to read. you need to use well-written copy and make use of good typography which will help make large amounts of content easier to digest.</p>

<p><strong>Transactional</strong> – these emails convey receipts and order info (i.e. recurly). These should be:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Focused</strong> – e.g. credit card / payment declined should not include anything else – no sales links or unnecessary information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Comprehensive</strong> – as much relative information as possible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Appropriate</strong> – no unnecessary images.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Practical</strong> – message needs to be obvious to user. The content needs to be actionable (without being inappropriate) and these emails above the rest should be readable on all devices and easily printed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Spartan</strong> – No excess design. At the most it can have the regular branding used on all emails.</p>

<h3>Choosing a Template</h3>

<p>I think you should keep to a minimal header and footer for our email template, which internal content changing.  Logo and ‘view online’ link as header followed by the contact details, copyright info and unsubscribe link in the footer.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome</strong> – this is a Join Me email. After the user signs up they receive this email. The important information included in this is their url, email, and (possibly) password. Bold ‘Get Started’ link the same as you use in the website. Secondary text and information can be a simple ‘Thank you for signing up’ and you should include, something like ‘This is a 14 day free trail to upgrade or cancel click here……’</p>

<p><strong>Get Started</strong> – these can be sent out a day after initial signup. This is a Read Me type email but due to the nature of it (get started) should be as clear as possible and short as possible. </p>

<p><strong>Invoice</strong> – sent after a subscription is confirmed. This Transaction email works well as it is. If it is possible you should build it into your system themed email with a minimal style header and footer. Unsubscribe shouldn’t be an option here.</p>

<p><strong>Sales</strong> – used to entice the user to sign up to the system. Buy Me type email. Again you can use the Call To Action link from the website. Clear images of the product should be used i.e. screenshot of system can be used here. Don&#39;t show anything too general, really showcase the product here.  You can build different campaigns to suit potential customers.</p>

<p><strong>Monthly Newsletter</strong> – This is a Read Me type email but once again because of its nature of being a Monthly Newsletter you can change the content slightly and introduce some Buy Me and Join Me elements too. When working with sections let us remember to keep the content easy to read using a nice typeface and meaningful images if you use them.</p>

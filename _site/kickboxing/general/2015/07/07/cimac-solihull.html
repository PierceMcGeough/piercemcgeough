  <article class="post-content">
    <p>This year I spent my 25th birthday officiating at the Cimacs in Solihull. I had attended this competition last year aswell although that time my birthday was the day before. This year I came over on the Friday evening and spent the first half of the weekend with my aunt Jennifer, squeezing in a nice wedding anniversary bbq with her friend.</p>

<p>This years competition got off to a bad start....I went to the wrong venue (last years place) but it was OK in the end as I arrived at the correct with plenty of time to get setup and running. Upon arriving I noticed a few familiar heads from back home. Sligo Mugendo and White Tigers representing the fighting Irish and doing us proud. </p>

<p>Partnered with veterns Sean Whelan, Dave Ryan (I don&#39;t know how a center ref can talk to much between points....its an art form) and Tanya Ledger (there was another guy but I forget his name, sorry if you are reading this), we headed a points fighting only area. While we had the ususal losing and switching of officials that you find at almost any competition we found that what really put us off our rhythm was being given sections to run that we were not allocated. I am unsure if the sections we were given to complete were originally for other areas or completely forgot about. All in all this lead to a long day in total.</p>

<p>After a lull on the area I stopped judging on the area and focused solely on organising fighters. We had enough other officials at this stage and we started flying through the division. I think some event organisiers forget or overlook the benefits of having that extra person to get things moving.</p>

<p>Sorry if I am seeming down about this competition but when it is long and you don&#39;t really have an end time to hand its one of the things that sticks out. That being said there were some great fights happening, the level is constantly growing. I never once heard of any complaints from fighters, coaches or anyone... which is not something we can say for every compeition.</p>

<p>Now to finish off with some parting words:</p>

<ul>
<li>We need to stop relying on officials who go off to coach their fighters. Don&#39;t put them down as a main official, let them be a floater and have enough full time officials to cover the area.</li>
<li><strong>Get an extra official on the areas</strong></li>
<li>Plan the sections and times. If you run a pre-reg only event there is no reason why you should have two sections that will clash running at the same time.</li>
</ul>

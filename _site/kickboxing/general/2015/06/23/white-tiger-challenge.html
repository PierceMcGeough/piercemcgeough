    <p>What a weekend at the White Tiger Challenge 2015 in the <a href="http://www.breaffyhouseresort.com/">Breaffy House Resort</a> in County Mayo, Ireland. Chief organiser Damien Gormley and crew really did they best to put on a great weekend for all. While every competition marks the coming together of friends, familys and rivals; the White Tiger Challenge is something more. It&#39;s a real family event that welcomes everyone to a fun friendly environment.</p>

<p>Another year with more international fighters and officials shows just how well respected and loved Damien and this competition is. It&#39;s not too often you will find numbers of figthers, coaches and parents travelling to another country for a non-international event. Along with flights for the internationals there were many 3 plus hour drives across the country.</p>

<p>This year saw the introduction of the spinner medal. The gold, silver, bronze and complimentary medals had a lovely spinning center piece. Damien once again raising the bar with the help of <a href="http://www.cookstowntrophies.com">Cookstown Trophies</a>. Champions t-shirts and grand champion trophies rounded out the prizes.</p>

<p>Friday, which I missed as I was only travelling over at this stage, was a night of training camps as far as I belive. This is a great addition to any competition and again adds to the welcoming atmosphere.</p>

<p>Saturday was light contact day. I&#39;ll admit I am a bit late in writing this and cannot for the life of my remember if there were any forms sections this day or not. I think there may have been only because I recall seeing a forms comptitor walking towards the resort Saturday morning. Not guna lie... also now wondering if there were kata/forms this day or not. I think Sunday was all points now. I enjoyed the morning here. Light contact didn&#39;t start until 12 noon which meant I had time to watch the musical forms/weapons and katas. While the musical forms and weapons may look more flashy with jumps, flips, weapons and music it is the katas the grab my attention. I enjoy watching the different karate styles. Since our own Mugendo Kickboxing system evolved from the Wado Ryu it&#39;s interesting to see te similarities between the different Wado styles.</p>

<p>The quality of the light contact was very good this year, including the novice sections. It is not very often that you return from a competition without 1 or 2 bad fights in your mind. Not this time. Granted there were a few once sided fights and a few tough to referee and judge but there were no really bad fights. Again a great sense of development from fighters and kickboxing in general.</p>

<p>Sunday was Points day. Starting off with the team events again is a great way to kick off the event. Some great battles were had today. From juniors up to seniors and teams to individuals. Everyone put on a great show of skill and talent. The grand champions divisions were again highlights of the day.</p>

<p>I like this format of light contact on one day and points fighting on the other. It really allows the competitors to pick and choose when they travel to these competitions. Again it may not suit those wishing to takepart in both but it is one variation that does work for many.</p>

<p>The next installment of this great competition is aready booked for June 18th &amp; 19th 2016 in the wonderful Breaffy House Resort. Why don&#39;t you book your rooms now and plan a competition an hoilday all in one.</p>
